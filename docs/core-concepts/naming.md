* Group name needs to be plural
* Component name needs to be singular
* Follow Single Responsibility Principle
* Component name shouldn't be related to any project or place in layout

   Bad: `filters`

   Good: `dropdown-list` or `collapsible-list`
* Avoid using `box`, `block`, `item`, `info`, `text`, `cms` in component names
* Avoid generous names like `info-box`, `new-label`
* Avoid naming two components in similar way i.e. `cms-subcategories` and `cms-subcategory`
