# Alpaca Components

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/SnowdogApps/magento2-alpaca-components.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)
[Design system](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/design-systems-vs-pattern-libraries-vs-style-guides-whats-difference/) created to speed up the process of working with design on Magento 2 stores, by creating each UI element, module, and view in an simplified, front-end developer friendly, environment.

Magento 2 experience isn't required to work with this code.

## Installation

## General information
Components documentation is built on top of [Fractal.js](http://fractal.build/guide)
